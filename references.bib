  title    = "Discovering governing equations from data by sparse
              identification of nonlinear dynamical systems",
  author   = "Brunton, Steven L and Proctor, Joshua L and Kutz, J Nathan",
  abstract = "Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has
              facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled
              technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites,
              and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to
              discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply
              from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity
              techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are
              parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability
              while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven
              problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings,
              inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial
              markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and
              controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy.
              With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of
              dynamics will continue to play an important role in these
              efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central
              challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data
              are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate
              science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to
              name only a few examples. In this work, we combine
              sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear
              dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy
              measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the
              model is that there are only a few important terms that govern
              the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of
              possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical
              systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse
              regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing
              equations required to accurately represent the data. This results
              in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model
              complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on
              a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems,
              including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz
              system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The
              fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover
              the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the
              community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this
              method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are
              time-varying or have external forcing.",

                   (SR), the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network
                   (SRCNN) has demonstrated superior performance to the
                   previous hand-crafted models either in speed and restoration
                   quality. However, the high computational cost still hinders
                   it from practical usage that demands real-time performance
                   (24 fps). In this paper, we aim at accelerating the current

                   for faster and better SR. We re-design the SRCNN structure
                   mainly in three aspects. First, we introduce a deconvolution
                   layer at the end of the network, then the mapping is learned
                   directly from the original low-resolution image (without
                   interpolation) to the high-resolution one. Second, we
                   reformulate the mapping layer by shrinking the input feature
                   dimension before mapping and expanding back afterwards.
                   Third, we adopt smaller filter sizes but more mapping
                   layers. The proposed model achieves a speed up of more than
                   40 times with even superior restoration quality. Further, we
                   present the parameter settings that can achieve real-time
                   performance on a generic CPU while still maintaining good
                   performance. A corresponding transfer strategy is also

              health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care
              means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for
              White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an

  abstract = "Supervised deep networks have achieved promising performance on
              image denoising, by learning image priors and noise statistics on
              plenty pairs of noisy and clean images. Unsupervised denoising
              networks are trained with only noisy images. However, for an
              unseen corrupted image, both supervised and unsupervised networks
              ignore either its particular image prior, the noise statistics,
              or both. That is, the networks learned from external images
              inherently suffer from a domain gap problem: the image priors and
              noise statistics are very different between the training and test
              images. This problem becomes more clear when dealing with the
              signal dependent realistic noise. To circumvent this problem, in
              this work, we propose a novel ``Noisy-As-Clean'' (NAC) strategy
              of training self-supervised denoising networks. Specifically, the
              corrupted test image is directly taken as the ``clean'' target,
              while the inputs are synthetic images consisted of this corrupted
              image and a second yet similar corruption. A simple but useful
              observation on our NAC is: as long as the noise is weak, it is
              feasible to learn a self-supervised network only with the
              corrupted image, approximating the optimal parameters of a
              supervised network learned with pairs of noisy and clean images.
              Experiments on synthetic and realistic noise removal demonstrate
              that, the DnCNN and ResNet networks trained with our
              self-supervised NAC strategy achieve comparable or better
              performance than the original ones and previous
              supervised/unsupervised/self-supervised networks. The code is
              publicly available at https://github.com/csjunxu/Noisy-As-Clean.",
