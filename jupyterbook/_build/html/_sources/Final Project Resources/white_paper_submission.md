# White Paper
**Due 10/12/2022**

To determine the topic for your project, you will submit a one-page white paper and a logical diagram of your proposed project. This white paper will not be graded. Instead, it will be used to make sure you are on the right track for your project. This white paper should describe:
1. The current problem you are trying to address
1. What is the current process that is used to solve the problem
1. Your approach to solving the problem. *Note it is okay if you do not know the exact methodology that you will use. This will be the primary area of our discussion*
1. Timeline for project completion

Please feel free to reach out to Prof. Agar in advance to discuss your topic and ideas. This project is meant to be a joint project between you and I. My primary goal is that you have a final product that you are proud to show and share to your colleagues, friends, and family. 

Submission instruction: Please submit your white paper on Blackboard Learn. It is preferred that you submit your document using MS Word, if not possible a PDF is acceptable.
