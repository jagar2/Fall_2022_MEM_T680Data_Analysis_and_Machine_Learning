<h5><strong>Excused Absences due to University Sponsored Activities</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#excused-absences-due-to-university-sponsored-activities" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>Many students participate in University-sponsored activities in which they represent the University or their academic college or department. Such activities may cause a student to be absent from class. In those instances, such absences qualify as ‚Äúexcused absences‚Äù which means that the absence, with proper prior arrangement, is not subject to penalty. Any missed coursework should be satisfied through agreement between the instructor and the student. Some examples of events that may qualify for excused absence include athletic competition, research or a presentation in which the student is an integral member of the presenting team, musical or performing arts events. To determine if an event qualifies as an excused absence, students are encouraged to discuss the activity with their instructor(s) and academic advisor prior to the absence.</p>
<p>Students seeking approval for an approved absence are responsible for notifying their instructor(s) at least two (2) weeks in advance of such absences. If the activity is at the beginning of the term or is the result of a particular level of achievement in an activity (i.e. qualifying for a post season tournament in athletics), students should notify their instructor(s) as soon as possible. Instructors are expected to make reasonable accommodations for these class absences including administration of make-up assignments and exams whenever possible. Please note, however, that the requirements of some courses or programs may preclude such accommodations.
It is expected that students seeking an excused absence will work with their instructor(s) to develop a plan and timetable to make up the missed coursework.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-absences">
<h5><strong>Other Absences</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#other-absences" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>Unforeseen events or circumstances may occur that cause a student to be absent from class. These could include personal or family illness, bereavement, accident, or a catastrophic event such as fire. If such issues arise, students are encouraged to notify their instructors as soon as possible to explain their absence from class. In doing so, students should review the syllabi for their courses with particular attention given to the instructor‚Äôs statements on course attendance and/or absences. Jointly, the student and instructor will develop a plan, with a timetable, to make up missed coursework. Instructors are expected to make reasonable accommodations for these class absences including administration of make-up assignments and exams whenever possible.</p>
<p>If an instructor is concerned that a student is providing false information regarding the reasons for their absence from class, the matter should be referred to the Dean or Dean‚Äôs designee for additional inquiry. Providing false information regarding the reasons for a course absence may be a violation of the Student Code of Conduct and result in disciplinary action, as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The only way to learn coding is to solve problems! It is essential for students to complete all of the homework assignments. The purpose of homeworks will for you to practice the concepts covered in class.  Completing all the homework problems is the best way to practice and prepare for quizzes and exams. \
If you need or desire an extension on any homework or lab for any reason, contact Prof. Agar in a timely fashion, as permitted by the need. There is no guarantee that you will receive an extension on any assignment, so plan your schedule carefully. Finally, you are encouraged to work with others on homeworks. Learning is a social activity! However, do not simply use others to do your work but rather use others to help work through and engage in the concepts. If you work with others on written homeworks, indicate on your assignment with whom you worked. \emph{Plagiarism is unacceptable} and will result in a zero grade for all persons involved, and will result in serious academic repercussions.</p>
<p>Homework should be submitted as a professional document, All homework should be submitted digitally. If you are of the opinion you deserve more credit than provided to you after your homework was graded, provide a written document explaining why you are of the opinion you desire this credit within a week of receiving the graded assignment.

<p>Prof. Agar honors the free exercise of religion. People from a wide variety of religious traditions live and work at Drexel, and the demands of religious observance in some traditions may cause conflicts with classroom and work schedules.</p>
<p>Prof. Agar will exempt any person who requests an absence due to the demands of religious holiday observance. Of course, nothing exempts a student from meeting course requirements or completing assignments, so the student will have to negotiate with the instructor any make-up work.</p>
<p>Accommodations are to be dealt with on the basis of individual requests from students. Recall that religious holidays are numerous, and no holiday is privileged above another.</p>
<p>If you encounter a schedule conflict with your course work due to the demands of religious observance, here is what you should do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Talk  with your instructor and indicate that you will be absent from class due to observance of religious holidays.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrange with the instructor to complete assignments.</p></li>

<h4>INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING<a class="headerlink" href="#individual-counseling" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The personal concerns of Drexel students vary greatly, and our Counseling Center offers goal-focused individual counseling for support. Students initially meet with a therapist for an assessment to discuss their presenting concerns and to determine the type of services which will best meet their needs.</p>

<section id="wellness-workshops">
<h4>WELLNESS WORKSHOPS<a class="headerlink" href="#wellness-workshops" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The Counseling Center offers several Emotional Wellbeing Workshops throughout the term that offer information, coping strategies, and tools to address common concerns faced by college students. We know that Drexel students are incredibly busy and can benefit from quick and useful tools for common presenting concerns. Workshops meet once a week for a series of 3-4 weeks for 50 minutes. Our Wellness Workshops are formatted so that you can expect a classroom-style learning environment, and you can share as much or as little as you want. Each workshop comes with a student workbook that allows you to practice new skills between sessions. Click here to see which Workshops are currently being offered.</p>
<p>If you are interested in attending any (or all!) of the workshops, schedule an Initial Consultation and tell your counselor. If you are already seeing a therapist at the Counseling Center, tell them you are interested in a workshop. You are free to do more than one workshop and to repeat them as often as you like! Check with the front desk for current scheduling and availability. When scheduled for an Emotional Wellbeing Workshop, you must come to each session on time, as the sessions build upon each other.</p>

<h4>REFERRAL SERVICES<a class="headerlink" href="#referral-services" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Our Case Manager is available for students who would like assistance connecting with an off-campus mental health provider.

Our Case Manager also assists in navigating insurance and helping think through the type of care and provider you might be interested in working with in the community. The Case Manager will also be sure to follow up with you to see if you need any further assistance.</p>

<section id="gender-and-sexual-identity">
<h3>Gender and Sexual Identity<a class="headerlink" href="#gender-and-sexual-identity" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>People commonly use gender and sexual orientation as part of their identity. A person‚Äôs identity should not be assumed based on societal norms or constructs as they are not related to a person‚Äôs self-identity. Unfortunately, English uses gendered pronouns. A culture of pronoun sharing will be cultivated in my classroom. If you do not know someone‚Äôs pronouns, it is preferred to use identity-agnostic (they/them) pronouns until you hear from them directly. Prof. Agar will not tolerate any bias or discrimination based on a person‚Äôs likeness or identity.</p>

<section id="academic-integrity-policy">
<h3>Academic Integrity Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Drexel University expects all members of its community to uphold the highest values of academic integrity. In upholding these values, the University is committed to investigating any allegation of violations of academic integrity against a student. Violations include, but are not limited to: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, and academic misconduct.</p>
<p>Sanctions for violations of academic integrity are administered through the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards in conjunction with the Office of the Provost and other University offices as deemed appropriate. It is generally the responsibility of the faculty member overseeing the academic activity to report the violation to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards and to determine the appropriate sanction. A student who believes they have been wrongly sanctioned has a right to an appeals process.</p>
<p>In addition to any other sanction, the University reserves the right in its sole discretion to withdraw an earned degree even though it has been granted should it be discovered at any time that the work upon which the degree was based, or the academic records in support of such degree, have been falsified. In that situation, the degree will be withdrawn promptly upon discovery of the falsification and the academic record will be updated to reflect the withdrawal of degree.</p>

<li><p>Form a study group! Working together will help you and others better understand the course material as you can work through different difficulties and offer each other clarifications on concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>Do problems! Reading through your notes is not enough. Seek out new problems and work through them carefully. When you are done, check your answer. If you are wrong, examine carefully what misunderstanding occurred and how to avoid it in the future. If you were correct, examine if there was a faster way, check to see if your solution <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">flowed</span></code> and was easy to read, and think over what concepts/computations were used and what <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type</span></code> of problem the exercise was.</p></li>
