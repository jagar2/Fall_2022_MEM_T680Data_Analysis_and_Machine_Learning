# # Introduction to the Course Machinery
# 

# ## How the Course is Built?

# * This course is built using `JupyterBook`. This is an open source tool that combines markdown files and `Jupyter Notebooks` into websites. 

# * All material for the course will be released openly on GitHub [https://github.com/jagar2/Fall_2022_MEM_T680Data_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning](https://github.com/jagar2/Fall_2022_MEM_T680Data_Analysis_and_Machine_Learning)

# * All code can be executed as Jupyter notebooks

# ## Accessing the Course Materials

# 
# * It is possible to access the course material on the JupyterBook website
# * You can clone the GitHub repository to access the source code

# ## Viewing the Course Materials

# There are three options to view the course material. 
# 
# 1. You can read the JupyterBook and run the code in colab as needed
# 1. You can download the raw .ipynb files and open them with any Jupyter Notebook reader.
# 1. You can view the jupyter notebooks as slides. 

# ### Viewing the Jupyter Notebook Slides
# 
# The notebooks can be views as executable sidles using RISE. To use this feature you will need to install the notebook extension.

# #### Installation
# 
# 1. Using conda 
# 
#   `conda install -c conda-forge rise`
# 
# 2. Using pip
# 
#   `pip install RISE`

# ```{note}
# If you installed the required packages from the `requirements.txt` RISE will already be installed
# ```

# After installation you should see the RISE logo to start the slideshow.

# ## Your Computing Environment
# 

# 
# There are many options for computing. Any method can be used as long as you are comfortable.
# 
# 1. Google Colab
