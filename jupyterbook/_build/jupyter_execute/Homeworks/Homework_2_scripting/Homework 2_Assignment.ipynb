    "### Question 1: Building Rocks, Paper, Scissors (40 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with \"rock\" sometimes being called \"stone,\" or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo) is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are \"rock\" (a closed fist), \"paper\" (a flat hand), and \"scissors\" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). \"Scissors\" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating \"victory\" or \"peace\") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors (\"rock crushes scissors\" or \"breaks scissors\" or sometimes \"blunts scissors\"), but will lose to one who has played paper (\"paper covers rock\"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors (\"scissors cuts paper\"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. The game spread from China while developing different variants in signs over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is your job to figure out how to implement this code. It should have the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Allows the user to select the number of games that defines a win (e.g., first to 3) (5-points).\n",
    "1. Allows the user to select their choice on trial (5-points).\n",
    "1. Print a statement saying if the player or computer won (the computer's choice is random) a single game (5-points).\n",
    "1. Simple error handling if an input is not a valid choice (5-points).\n",
    "1. Control to exit if the user types an \"exit\" command (5-points).\n",
    "1. Tells the player who won the overall game (5-points).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a working and playable game (10-points).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `randint` package can be used to generate a random integer\n",
    "2. `break` can be used to exit a loop and return\n",
    "3. The `input` function can be used to ask the user for an input\n",
    "4. `isinstance` command can tell you if a variable is of a specific type\n",
